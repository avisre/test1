                    <p><strong>1. Context:</strong>The lead academic founders were looking for a fractional CEO that would lead the spinout of MeOmics from Cardiff University, to enable the company to scale into a self-sustaining commercial entity with huge impact potential.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Approach:</strong>A strategic roadmap for the MeOmics spin-out was developed.  Alasdair led the company as CEO in its spin-out from Cardiff University, through angel funding and a successful Innovate UK grant application.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Outcome:</strong>Under Alasdair's leadership, MeOmics successfully spun out from Cardiff University and secured around £700,000 in grants and angel investment.</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Context:</strong>The CEO of this early stage company was deeply frustrated with the disconnect between his sales and engineering teams. This issue was stifling growth and making forecasting and planning for growth all but impossible.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Approach:</strong>Alasdair entered the business as Fractional/Interim COO. He identified the need to model the business processes to identify opportunities for implementation of appropriate and proportionate toolset to support the excellent people in the business. He then led the implementation of the tools, and ensured the correct training and support was put in place.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Outcome:</strong>The project resulted in successful definition of the processes, people and technology operation architecture to support the 50% growth that the company is now realising.</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Context:</strong>The founder and CEO was looking for an exit within the next few years. She invited Alasdair to step in as Non-Executive chair to prepare for and maximise the value of the exit.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Approach:</strong>We established board governance protocols, developed a company options scheme for key staff and developed a strategy for an exit at a time to be chosen by the Founder/CEO.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Outcome:</strong>The success of Eddyline Ventures’ involvement in Nine Lives Media will be a successful exit in 3 to 5 years for the owner.</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Context:</strong>The majority owner of i3Secure had invested in founding i3Secure as part of the i3Works group of companies.  It was a disaster with the four founding directors not working well together at all. </p>
                    <p><strong>2. Approach:</strong>The first phase was to stabilise the situation by engaging with the leadership team to build a new business strategy. Our second engagement was focussed on planning for growth. Our third stint was all about implementing the strategies we had defined in the previous engagement.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Outcome:</strong>Eddyline Ventures' project saved this company and returned it to a trajectory of 50% year on year growth.</p>
